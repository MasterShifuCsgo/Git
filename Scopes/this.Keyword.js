you might think that the this keyword pints to

//  this proves that the this keyword

const f = jonas.calcAge;
// this copies calcage function to f variable.

// But you arent calling it. You are assinging it

// now what happens when you call it.
// spoilers!
// undefined
// and also this error where it cant find
// this.year anywhere, i think ou know why.
// there is no owner to the function call
// therefore it proves my point again.
